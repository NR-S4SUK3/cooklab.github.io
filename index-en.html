 * incredians
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs
2 tablespoons plain yogurt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon chili powder (adjust based on spice preference)
Salt to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
Lemon wedges for serving
Fresh coriander leaves (optional, for garnish)
Instructions:

Marination:

In a bowl, mix yogurt, vegetable oil, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala, chili powder, salt, and black pepper to form a smooth marinade.
Prepare Chicken:

Clean and pat dry the chicken pieces.
Make shallow cuts or slashes on the chicken to allow the marinade to penetrate.
Marinate Chicken:

Coat the chicken pieces thoroughly with the prepared marinade, making sure each piece is well-covered.
Place the chicken in the refrigerator and let it marinate for at least 2-4 hours, or preferably overnight for more flavor.
Preheat Grill:

Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.
Grilling:

Remove the marinated chicken from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature for about 15-20 minutes.
Thread the chicken onto skewers or place them directly on the grill grates.
Grill for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and has a nice char.
Serve:

Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes.
Serve the grilled Indian-spiced chicken with lemon wedges and garnish with fresh coriander leaves if desired.
This flavorful grilled chicken pairs well with naan, rice, or a side of raita. Adjust the spice levels according to your preference. Enjoy your delicious Indian-spiced grilled chicken!",
